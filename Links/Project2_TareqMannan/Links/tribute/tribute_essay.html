<p>		The article is “Men developing emotional intelligence through meditation? Integrating narrative, cognitive and electroencephalography (EEG) evidence” and created by Tim Lomas, Trudi Edginton, Tina Cartwright and Damien Ridge. The Study is about finding out whether meditation helps men improve their emotional intelligence and as a result give them better mental health. The paper asks three questions that it seeks to find answers to and they are: 1) will meditation improve men’s attention skills? 2) Will these skills help men with their emotional management abilities? 3) Will these abilities benefit their wellbeing? This research has merit in that it can help many men that are currently suffering with their mental state and this is evidence by the growing rate of suicides among men. Despite the benefits that this study’s findings will help men with, the study fails to stand on its own.</p>
<p>		As the study has stated it is one of first to study the link between meditation and emotional intelligence. It aims to research the connection via a longitudinal mixed methods design. 30 subjects were recruited from universities, meditation centers and from a Buddhist convention. The subjects were grouped as novice for those who practice meditation a few years and elders for those who practiced meditation for a long time. The study examined the subjects with questions about themselves and meditation. The subjects then had undergone a series of tests that included DISS which tested executive attention. RMET measured emotional intelligence and NART which tests their intelligence prior to having brain disease. </p>
<p>		EEG signals were recorded from using electrodes at f3 and f4 of the front region of the brain. Electrodes were also placed in the mastoids of m1 and m2. The EEG signals were used to examine brain waves during meditation and DISS. After the findings were recorded, the subjects were tested again a year later. Because the study had both a mix of within subjects design and between groups design ANOVA was used. The results found that meditation does help men with their mental health. The study found that meditation does improve men’s attention abilities, improve their emotional attention and as a result enhance their wellbeing. </p>
<p>		The study fails to stand on its own because it requires assistance from other articles to support their findings. Using other research findings for assistance is not an issue but this study failed to connect the emotional intelligence to wellbeing due to its experimental design. As the paper has noted that the issue was its design and it suggested that its findings are supported by another research article that proved a connection. Using another paper to establish that its own findings are indeed connected is not substantial enough. Although the only 30 subjects were used in the paper stating that its findings proved its questions is not good enough. This is generalizing the findings on 30 subjects and comparing it to millions of people who meditate for decades such as the Buddhist monks.</p>
<p>		The paper is beneficial in possibly bringing more studies done on meditation in connection to men’s emotional intelligence. The next step should be on meditation over decades and on millions of people who meditate. Prayers performed by many religious people and Monks especially should be evaluated. Because the study had a qualitative design, the design should be more quantitative and designed to connect emotional intelligence to wellbeing. </p>
